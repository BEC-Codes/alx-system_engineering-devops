# Web stack debugging #0

This was the first in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these
projects, I was given broken/bugged webstacks in the form of Docker
containers, and tasked with fixing the web stack to a working state. For each
task, I wrote a Bash script including the commands necessary to fix the
web stack.

## Tasks

* **0. Give me a page!**
  * [0-give_me_a_page](./0-give_me_a_page): Bash script that runs Apache on a
web server and gets it to respond to queries to the root.
