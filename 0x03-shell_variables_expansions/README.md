In this project, I learned about initialization files, variables and expansions in the Shell as well as how to use the alias command.

* `0-alias`: Script that creates an alias named `ls` with value `rm *`.
* `1-hello_you`: Script that prints `hello user`, where user is the current Linux user.
* `2-path`: Script that adds `/action` to the `PATH`.
* `3-paths`: Script that counts the number of directories in the `PATH`.
* `4-global_variables`: Script that lists environment variables.
* `5-local_variables`: Script that lists all local variables, environment variables and functions.
* `6-create_local_variable`: Script that creates a new local variable named `BETTY` with value `Holberton`.
* `7-create_global_variable`: Script that creates a new global variable named `HOLBERTON` with value `Betty`.
* `8-true_knowledge`: Script that prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE`, followed by a new line.
* `9-divide_and_rule`: Script that prints the result of `POWER` divided by `DIVIDE`. `POWER` and `DIVIDE` are environment variables.
* `10-love_exponent_breath`: Script that displays the result of `BREATH` to the power of `LOVE`. `BREATH` and `LOVE` are environment variables.
* `11-binary_to_decimal`: Script that converts a number in base 2 stored in the environment variable `BINARY` to base 10.
* `12-combinations`: Script that prints all possible combinations of two letters, except `oo`, as follows:

  * Letters are lower cases, from `a` to `z`.
  * One combination per line.
  * Alpha-ordered.

* `13-print_float`: Script that prints a number stored in the environment variable `NUM` with two decimal places.
* `14-decimal_to_hexadecimal`: Script that converts a number in base 10 stored in the environment variable `DECIMAL` to base 16.
