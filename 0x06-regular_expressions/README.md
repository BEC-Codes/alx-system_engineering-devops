# Regular expression

In this project, I learned how to use regular expressions. I practiced building 
them using Ruby's Oniguruma library.

## Tasks

_Note: Each Ruby script in the project matches regular expressions based on an 
argument passed to it via the command line._

* **Simply matching Holberton**
  * `0-simply_match_holberton.rb`: Ruby script that matches the regular 
expression `Holberton`.

* **Repetition Token #0**
  * `1-repetition_token_0.rb`: Ruby script that matches the regular 
expression `hbn` with between 2-5 `t`'s in between `hb` and `n`.

* **Repetition Token #1**
  * `2-repetition_token_1.rb`: Ruby script that matches the regular
expression `hn` with 0 or 1 occurrences of `b` and 0 or 1 occurrences of `t` 
in between `h` and `n`.

* **Repetition Token #2**
  * `3-repetition_token_2.rb`: Ruby script that matches the regular 
expression `hbn` with 1 or more `t`'s in between `hb` and `n`.

* **Repetition Token #3**
  * `4-repetition_token_3.rb`: Ruby script that matches the regular expression 
`hbn` with 0 or more `t`'s in between `hb` and `n`.

* **Not quite HBTN yet**
  * `5-beginning_and_end.rb`: Ruby script that matches a regular expression
starting with `h` and ending with `n` with any single character in between.

* **Call me maybe**
  * `6-phone_number.rb`: Ruby script that matches a regular expression 
representing a 10-digit phone number.

* **OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?**
  * `7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb`: Ruby script that matches regular 
expressions of uppercase letters.

* **Textme**
  * `100-textme.rb`: Ruby script that runs statistics on TextMe app text 
message transcations.
  * Output: `[SENDER],[RECEIVER],[FLAGS]` where
    * `[SENDER]` is the sender phone number or name (including country code 
if present).
    * `[RECEIVER]` is the receiver phone number or name (including country code 
if present).
    * `[FLAGS]` is the flags that were used.

* **Pass LinkedIn technical interview level0**
  * `101-passed_linkedin_regex_challenge.jpg`: Screenshot signifying completion 
of the [LinkedIn Engineering Regex Puzzle](https://engineering.linkedin.com/puzzle).
